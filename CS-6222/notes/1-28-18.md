- example of decrypting and encrypting

```
		M = 'CAT'
		C=   FDW	

```	
	Caesar cipher, to decrypt you shift each letter left by 3 and encrypting is shift each letter right by 3. 

	Think what is the key? What are we changing to get our message?
	Are the encryption and decryption using the same algorithm? No
	We are changing the position of the letter to encrypt and decrypt. Therefore the key is the position of the letter that we shift to get our message.

- example of public key cryptography
	
```
	Alice to Bob

		    C1C2
	C = Esa(M) ----->  Dpa(C2`) = h(M)
	
	C1 = ciphertext
	C2 = signature	
```
	Will the data length for C1 and C2 be the same? Yes, but the inputs would be different, you will use the public key for C1 and use the private key of the sender for C2.
