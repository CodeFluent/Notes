=================




## Why is this here?

Ehh, I decided to take all my crap notes I've gained through all my years of schooling and put it all for the world to see. It is also a museum for my terrible handwriting.

## What do you plan on doing with it?

Probably finding a way to make it a little bit more interactive when I have the time. [Autotune](https://github.com/voxmedia/autotune) by Voxmedia seems like a good way to go. Or I may just create something that'll input text to certain divs.

## Will it be updated regularly?

Probably not honestly. However, I'll try my best to make sure to archive my notes every year's end.

## What can I do with it?

Well, at the bottom of this README file is the [Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). This means anyone, including individuals and companies, can take my notes and use them for whatever they want to as long as it points back to me.

If you're a student or teacher I highly recommend that you make your own notes.

If you want to read any of these files, they are in Markdown format. Use a Markdown editor like [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) or insert a plugin to your favorite text editor.

Original bringing for this knowledge goes to following professors at Georgia State University:

 - [Dr. Jeremy Brazas](http://www2.gsu.edu/~jbrazas/)
 - [Aaron Paul Sullivan](http://philpapers.org/profile/62099) (Soon to be masters or docorate I believe)
 - [Dr. Faidra Papavasiliou](http://www2cas.gsu.edu/anthropology/4027.html)
 - [Dr. Ruili Wang](http://shared.cas.gsu.edu/profile/ruili-wang/)

I've had a ton of teachers from all over the place that I've not mentioned here, but thank you for all you did to make me stand where I am today.
