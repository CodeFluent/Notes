/* TODO:10 Write an assembly language program to find the maximum of y= 3x^4 - 10x^2 - 15x.
    for the range -4 <= x <= 6.

    During each iteration, print out a message stating the current value of x and the corresponding value of y.

    After all iterations, print out a final message stating the max value of y and the corresponding value of x (6) that generated  ymax. If there are multiple values of x that generate ymax, you only need to indicate one of them.

    TODO:20 Also, make sure to define the values of the coefficents 3, 10, and 15 as constants a1, a2, and a3.
