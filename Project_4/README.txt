SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
=========================================================

You will need to have this done.html page running on some sort of webserver or other ftp/http complaint service. The javascript runs with local file origin enabled since lesmis.json is hardcoded.

An example webserver in python is

> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

and browse to localhost:8000.
