# 8/29 Notes

- Checkbox control, radio button, and options controls


### Checkbox Control

- Most languages with GUI toolkits have checkboxes, however they are implemented by enums since you can have 3 states: *unchecked, checked, and disabled.*

- However, Java doesn't have enums and therefore forces buttons to just have checked and unchecked states, with disabled being a state in another method.

- Parent widgets that are disabled also have their children disabled. 

- In javafx, we need to sync states of buttons, so we can do: 

```
    Checkbox cb = new Checkbox("Check me!");
    add(b, 0, 50);

    Button b = new Button("Print");
    add(b, 0 , 50);
    
    b.setOnAction( 
        (event) -> System.out.println(cb.selectedProperty().get());
    );

    // Bindings.not will sync the checkbox with the button.
    b.disableProperty().bind(Bindings.not(cb.selectedProperty()));
```

### Radio Buttons
- Some GUI kits either allow you to have no radio button selected or, by default, one selected. 
- JavaFx does the former, but it will return *null*.
- Most GUI kits have a button group function that allow to see if one button is selected.


### Comobo Box
- Most GUI toolkits make combo boxes a custom type instead of set types of string, however, 
this introduces a complication of new types. 

e.g. 

```
// how do we render a type aircraft? 
ComboBox<aircraft>
cbox.value();
```

- The solution is to provide a mechanism that can render whatever is inside the ComboBox.
- JavaFX's ComboBox is made to use strings, so it can render whatever string value would be 
introduced to it, so we can render a type aircraft using custom rendering.
