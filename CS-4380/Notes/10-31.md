# Custom Widget Making

So we want to make some cool stuff like a gauge, a nice graph plot, or a pagination app. However, there are no in-built APIs usually to help render custom widgets to make these possible. Most graphical kits use an on_render function where a render() function has things like squares, circles, lines, and set fills to help create the render either in a canvas or through primitive shapes.

Both Javafx and WPF support the ability of the render function.

# Circles Widget - Rendering the Canvas

- Also called "pagination app" by me lol. looks like:

circle - circle - circle

with the dashes being lines with spaces between circles and lines.


Psuedocode or Qt code
```
widget:: page_count
widget:: render(canvas c):
    // renders each of the circles and each of the lines.
    cur_center = s+r // center of current circle being drawn
    for p in page_count
        c.draw.circle(cur_center)
        c += r+s+l+s+r
widget:: get_size():
    // for the layout manager to allocate space
    size.x = pagecount * d + (2 * page_count * s) + (page_count - 1) * l
    return size
```

- Circle has diameter d or radius r, margin space s, line length l
- So our forumla to render our circles and line will be s+r+ i(r+s+l+s+r) with i as the number of circles.

- When does the render function run?
    - When the window size changes, When the window is covered (the output buffer of the window would be covered, so we could drop it and then redraw when the window becomes uncovered), when pagecount changes

```
circlesWidget::set_page_c(c):
    page_count = c
    this.damage() // qt function that says that current layout render is changed and needs to be rerendered.
```
- You don't want to rerender immediately since the user might do other things like increase the pagecount and change window size at the same time. So be sure to get all changes before rerendering.


# Circles Widget - Rendering a Cavas Container with Primitives

- Instead of using circles and lines, we use nodes and arcs to render the view. This is the newer way of rendering.

Psuedocode or javafx
```
CirclesWidget(pagecount c):
    this.children.clear();
    cur_center = s+r;
    for(p to c):
        Circle ctr = new Circle();
        c.move_to(cur_center);
        this.children.add(ctr);
        cur_ctr = ...
```
- While the above may look easier, it does have some issues. Particularly in this case, if you set the sizes and then do something else to the window, you will be stuck with it. This is how progressbars in javafx works since it expands until its preferred size and then stops. 


# Example code

- Bunch of files...

Circles.java
```
public class Circles extends Pane {
    private Vector<PageRequestHandler> pageHandlers; 

    private int pageCount;
    private int currentPage;

    private double padding;
    private double radius;

    public Circles() {
        pageHandlers = new Vector<PageRequestHandler>();

        pageCount = 0;
        currentPage = 0;
        padding = 10.0;
        radius = 40.0;
        
        this.setPadding(new Insets(padding));
    }

    public void setPageCount(int count) throws CircleException {
        if(count < 0) {
            throw new CirclesException("Page count is out of bounds");
        }

        pageCount = count; 

        this.getChildren().clear();

        Double curCenter = padding;
        for(int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            Circle circle = new Circle(radius, Color.RED);
            circle(curCenter, padding); // x, y
            this.getChildren.add(circle);

            Integer I = new Integer(i); // need a final variable for our mouse click.
            circle.setOnMouseClicked(
                new EventHandler<MouseEvent>() {
                    @Override
                    public void handle(MouseEvent me) {
                        emitPageEvent(I);
                    }
                }
            );

            curCenter += radius + radius + padding;
        }

        this.setMinWidth(padding + (pageCount * (radius + radius + padding))); // adds padding for the circle, the diamter of the circle itself, then another padding.
        this.setMinHeight(padding + radius + radius+ padding);
    }

    public void setCurrentPage(int page) {
        
        int cp = 0;

        for (Node n: this.getChildren()) {
            if (n instanceof Circle) {
                if (cp < page>) {
                    cp.setFill(Color.GREEN);
                } 
                else if (cp > page) {
                    cp.setFill(Color.YELLOW);
                }    
                else {
                    cp.setFill(Color.RED);
                }

                cp += 1;
            }         
        }
        currentPage = page;
    }

    // handler functions omitted

    public void emitPageEvent(int number) {
        for(PageRequestHandler)
    }    

}
```


CirclesApp.java
```

Circles cs = new Circles();

try {
    cs.setPageCount(5);
    cs.setCurrentPage(3);
} catch(CirclesException ce) {
    // throw a message
}

cs.addPageRequestHandler((int id) -> {
    System.out.println("Page requested: " + id);
});
```

# SideNote

Integer I = new Integer(i); in line 103 of this doc.

Need a final, i right now is allocated in stack and will be deleted, but I is heap allocated and will hold reference after the for loop is complete. Therefore it is able to be final and can be used in our MouseEvent.

# Improvements to our Circles Widget

buildLayout(count) // would build the layout, setting the minheight and minwidth
markPage(page) // mark the current page

setCurrentPage is being called a lot of times with little variation, so it should be automatically updated.
