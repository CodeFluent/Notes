**Logic**
- Connotatively means concept, idea, or "ultimate reality"
- Aristotle: "Laws of Reason"; Laws exist before and after the universe
- New Testament: Logic was God, the was fleshed and clothed
- Russell says that even if practical man exists, then there will be something missing. Physical sciences affect everyone physically even if they don't say it.

- Philosophy expands and freezes the mind that allows for the removal of other pressures.
- People mentally free are allowed to be practically free.
