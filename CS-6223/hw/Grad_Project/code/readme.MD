To run the code:

- Install the latest version of python 3 on your system
- Do `python -m pip install --user numpy pandas`, these will install the dependencies in your system.
- Now you can just do `python runme.py`. The code should take only a couple seconds to run.
- The output dataset will be in `LP_output.csv`

Note you might need sudo or admin priveleges to run some operations.

If you wish to change the epsilon value, go to line 73 in runme.py and edit the number at the end of the line to the desired value.
