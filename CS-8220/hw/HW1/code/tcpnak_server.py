tcpnakserver.py

A tcp server made in python.
Some variable and function names from socketserver.py in python 3.7 release.
Made by Wasfi Momen.

"""

"""
REQUIREMENTS
    - ~~Capitalizes strings~~
    - ~~Max 10 strings~~
    - ~~Client ask for termination~~ **"Appropiate message" to terminate is Ctrl+C**
    - ~~Limit reached, send message to client~~
    - ~~Multithreaded~~
    ALL COMPLETE

ISSUES
    - Non-graceful shutdown of more than two clients. Exception will be raised
