here's the questions and short answers that I asked Cao (Paraphrasing a
lot):


1. *Are we to find a problem or improve the solution of the paper?*
     ```For the project, your goal should be convincing the class of the
problem presented
     in the paper and your interpretation of the problem.```
2. *Are queuing theory and network scheduling the same thing?*
    ```Not exactly, they are not interchangeable terms but they do have
some influence
    over one another. Queuing is what we learned in class where we look
at the length
    of packets to determine scale. Network scheduling is considering
action, how long
    that action will take.```
3. *Would improving the DAG schedule be good to implement?*
    ```Yea, it'd be a good idea to look for improvement in a small
section of the problem
    or try to look at specific situation to improve. For example, the
paper talks about
    a general scenario that might fail in specific cases. Fixing the
algo in a specific case
    to the best small space is a good topic for a paper.```
4. *How to model the problem in a VM or other sort of simulation?*
    ```Try not to do scale since don't have resource, but you do have to
just convince
    that within a small space of the problem that you improved and show
results
    that it functions for larger scales through some metric.```
5. *LP problem? There are lots of papers with LP?*
     ```Lots of the paper has LP. Not expecting you to know the theory,
but you can focus
     on small section of LP. There are many variables you just need to
focus on one and
     provide implementation.```
6. *Any suggestion for simulation software? Like GN3 in the HW, TA
suggested NS2?*
    ```Not familiar with many software and no knowledge of what'd work
best. Just focus on
    specific variables to simulate.```
7. *Visualization for the problem?*
    ```It is up to you to show how best to show the concepts of the
paper. You can use
    equations, but make sure the class understands.```
