    Purpose: The purpose of this program is to take a file with words and see if any of them are anagrams. If there are we will print them out on a single line in the output file. The objective is to gain experience in String objects, arrays, and generic algorithms as well as experiment with Java's File I/O methods.

    Solution: The solution for this program will open the file, sanitize the data so that we can compare strings without any punctuation or case issues, compare the strings using the characters and length of the String to see if it is an anagram, and then outputting the original Strings to another file.


    Data Structures Used: Arrays

    Program Use: User will input a file containing words, program computes the anagram of words, and outputs a file output.txt with all the words that are anagrams of each other on the same line.

    // We use inHere() to check for whether a value in the signatures array has already been scanned and identified as
    // a set of anagrams. That way, we handle the problem of printing out a word on a new line even though it has already been
    // identified as anagram and is already on another line.

    //     - Array1 has already been sanitized without any punctuation and case. It also assumes array1 has no null values.
