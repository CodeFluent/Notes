class MeterNode (practical.Node):
    '''
    This class implements a Paxos node that provides a reasonable assurance of
    progress through a simple heartbeating mechanism that is used to detect
    leader failure and initiate leadership acquisition.

    If one or more heartbeat messages are not received within the
    'liveness_window', leadership acquisition will be attempted by sending out
    phase 1a, Prepare messages. If a quorum of replies acknowledging leadership
    is received, the node has successfully gained leadership and will begin
    sending out heartbeat messages. If a quorum is not received, the node will
    continually send a prepare every 'liveness_window' until either a quorum is
    established or a heartbeat with a proposal number greater than its own is
    received. The units for hb_period and liveness_window is seconds and floating
    point values may be used for sub-second precision.

    Leadership loss is detected by way of receiving a heartbeat message from a proposer
    with a higher proposal number (which must be obtained through a successful phase 1).
    Or by receiving a quorum of NACK responses to Accept! messages.

    This process does not modify the basic Paxos algorithm in any way, it merely seeks
    to ensure recovery from failures in leadership. Consequently, the basic Paxos
    safety mechanisms remain intact.
