Solution to Homework 3 Question 2. Main file with algorithm is "nn_kernel.cu".


To run using Visual Studio,
	- Be sure to use Visual Studio 2017. Newer versions might be fine.
	- Make sure to install Windows SDK 10.0.15063.0 (You can do this from the "Visual 
	Studio Installer and check for it under "Individual Components Tab". Might have to click 
	"Modify" in the launch screen)
	- Make sure to install CUDA toolkit 10.1
	- Open the solution file
	- Build and run the solution
	- Regret everything and switch back to Linux because its simpler. 


Congrats! If you did everything right you should see the result in the "output" folder. 
You will have also wasted 10 allotted hours trying to deal with Visual Studio. (+4 knowledge +10 hatred for Windows -8 hours of sleep)
