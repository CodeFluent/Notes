# 10-12 Notes
- Been writing more code in notes since I don't have the repo cloned on my Linux laptop (gotta clean it up first its too big)

# More work on implementing custom events

BasicHandler.java
```
@FunctionalInterface
public interface BasicHandler {
  public void handle(String input_string);
}
```

- Here the annotation FunctionalInterface tells Java this function can use the lamdba arrow function. 
If the annotation isn't there it may still work, but don't chance it.

BasicWidget.java
```
public class BasicWidget extends GridPane {
  private Vector<BasicHandler> handlers = new Vector<BasicHandler>();
  
  public BasicWidget() {
    TextField tf = new TextField();
    add(tf, 0, 0);
    
    Button b = new Button("Submit");
    add(b, 1, 0);
    
    b.setOnAction(
      (event) -> {
        String str = tf.getText();
        for (BasicHandler bh: handlers) {
          bh.handle(str);
        }
      });
  }
  
  public void addBasicHandler(BasicHandler bh) { 
  // BasicHandler is the same as setOnAction(), that is you can use setOnAction with it without issues as long as you
  // declare it as the interface above in BasicHandler.java.
    handlers.add(bh);
  }
  
}
```

Runner.java
```
public class BasicRunner extends Application {
  @Override
  public void start(Stage stage) {
      BasicWidget root = new BasicWidget();

      root.addBasicHandler(
      (String str) -> {System.out.println(str);
      });
      
      Scene scene = new Scene(root, 600, 800);
      
      stage.setTitle("In Class");
      stage.setScene(scene);
      stage.show();
  }

}

```

- So we wrote our "event" but used a basic parameters like 
```
    root.addBasicHandler(
        (String str) -> {
          //blahh
        });
```
 but normally people prefer that you use an event just like all other functions.
```
     root.addBasicHandler(
        (event) -> {
          //blahh
        });
```
and your interface like 

```
public void handle(ActionEvent e)
```

However, this might seem unncessarily verbose to the user, so you may wish to just use a string or number or whatever you want. The advantage of using an event is that they have some idea of the scope of the layout that you are using like GridPane or VBox.
