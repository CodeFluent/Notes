# 10-12 Notes
- Been writing more code in notes since I don't have the repo cloned on my Linux laptop (gotta clean it up first its too big)

# More work on handle functions

BasicHandler.java
```
@FunctionalInterface
public interface BasicHandler {
  public void handle(String input_string);
}
```

- Here the annotation FunctionalInterface tells Java this function can use the lamdba arrow function. 
If the annotation isn't there it may still work, but don't chance it.

Basic Widget.java
```
public class BasicWidget extends GridPane {
  private Vector<BasicHandler> handlers = new Vector<BasicHandler>();
  
  public BasicWidget() {
    TextField tf = new TextField();
    add(tf, 0, 0);
    
    Button b = new Button("Submit");
    add(b, 1, 0);
  }
  
  
}
```
