# Custom Widget Making

So we want to make some cool stuff like a gauge, a nice graph plot, or a pagination app. However, there are no in-built APIs usually to help render custom widgets to make these possible. Most graphical kits use an on_render function where a render() function has things like squares, circles, lines, and set fills to help create the render either in a canvas or through primitive shapes.

Both Javafx and WPF support the ability of the render function.
