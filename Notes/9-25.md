# PythonGTK

- GTK is a popular library for UI that was forked from the GIMP software repo once people saw creating UIs for Linux was not terrible.

- GTK is currently in 3.0, but PythonGTK, the python offset of GTK, is in GTK 2.0 and therefore has to manage upstream changes.

- GTK has been "infamously verbose" which is a good and bad thing. However, it has lead to the GTK team to seek out other languages or implementations that might help alleviate some of the problems and confusion.
    - One of these implementations is **Vala** which is a java-looking C language, but it is very early in development.


## G Object Introspection
- So since the gtk versions of PythonGTK are in the past, to access the new bindings for 3.0 there is something called Gobject Introspection.

- Gobject Introspection *queries* objects within the gtk library to find out methods that can be acted on them as well as find properties of each object.
    - This is all at **runtime**, which means things like Intellisense don't work, Python !help does not work (since the documentation of an object might be different), and other such things break.


## Coding with GTK library

**Basic setup**
```
#! /usr/bin/python3

import gi
gi.require_version import Gtk

win = Gtk.Window(title="Weakly-Typed Window")
hbox = Gtk.Box()
win.add(hbox)

firstB = Gtk.Button.new_with_label(label="first!")
hbox.pack_start(firstB, True, True, 3) // component, growth, fill, padding

secondB = Gtk.Button.new_with_mnemonic(label="second")
hbox.pack_start(secondB, True, True, 3)

win.connect("delete-event", Gtk.main_quit) // adds a close out event
win.show_all()

Gtk.main();
```

**Adding events to buttons**
```
secondB.connect("clicked", lambda widget: print("I was clicked!")) // only one statement allowed, but can be a function. lambda is a callback function.

```

**Can add a new class with PythonGTK unlike GTK which requires a headache**

```
#! /usr/bin/python3

import gi
gi.require_version import Gtk

win = Gtk.Window(title="Weakly-Typed Window")
hbox = Gtk.Box()
win.add(hbox)

firstB = Gtk.Button.new_with_label(label="first!")
hbox.pack_start(firstB, True, True, 3) // component, growth, fill, padding

secondB = Gtk.Button.new_with_mnemonic(label="second") // mneomics are just buttons with a key binding to them. Here it'll be Alt+S.
hbox.pack_start(secondB, True, True, 3)

win.connect("delete-event", Gtk.main_quit) // adds a close out event
win.show_all()

Gtk.main()

class ExWindow(Gtk.Window):
    // python likes self, since it is better to be explicit in what self is.
    // super() gets the extended object's parent constructor (java does it automatically)
    def __init__ (self, title):
        super().__init__(title)

        hbox = Gtk.Box()

        button = Gtk.Button.new_with_mnemonic("Click Me!")
        button.connect("clicked", self.clicked)
        hbox.pack_start(button, True, True, 3)

        self.add(hbox)

    def clicked (self, source)
        print("clicked!");

e = ExWindow("E X T R A C L I C K E D")
e.show_all()


Gtk.main()

```

**Where is the self coming from in clicked?**
```
    def clicked (self, source)
        print("clicked!");

// Actually in our e class
e = ExWindow("E X T R A C L I C K E D")

// it actually has a property
e.clicked = lambda(lambda widget: clicked())
// 
```
