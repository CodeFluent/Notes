- Progress Bars, Sliders, and Container Widgets

# Progress Bars
- Indicate an action that we don't know when will complete (indeterminate state)or an action that progresses with time.

```
main: 
    set-up
    loop main:
        update
        event
        idle
        redraw
        
    // in progress bars we know the code has not exited the main loop since it should be in the main loop since our window
    // has not disappeared and closed out.
```

- Thread sync issues: sometimes in the update, event, idle, and redraw cycle, the update of a progress bar occurs in the
redraw state, meaning that the progress bar would mess up. Say the render code of the progress bar had a double loop
that rendered it, then the second loop would execute at a *different* percentage and mess up the progress bar.

- Threaded applications should execute only on the events on widgets that they were declared in.


# Sliders 
- Sometimes sliders depend on type and range for GUI toolkits.

```
type -> current value
     |-> range (min/max)
```

# Container Widget
- Simple extension of a Basic Widget with a border around it.
- Uses Decorator Pattern where child doesn't affect other components. Can add a GridPane to a Container Widget.
